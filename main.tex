\subsection{The Client}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=6cm]{client information 2.png}


\subsection{The Project}

\textbf{Candia Cameo} is a company that produces Exquisite Moissanite Jewelry in the UAE, and sells them online through social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. It also has an up and running website where customers can make their payments online.\\
To increase their customer reach and provide their clients with the best online jewelry shopping experience, they are requesting another E-commerce web application that meets all the requirements they want for their business.\\
So, as part of our Software Engineering project, we decided to contact the company and convince them to give us the job.\\ Since, all 3 of us in the team have taken the database course, we think this project is a perfect fit for us to apply what we've learned and further expand our experience in Database Management Systems.\\

\subsection{Programming Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Operating Systems}\\
    \textit{Microsoft Windows 10}
    \item \textbf{Platforms}\\
    \textit{Visual Studio Code, EditorX}
    \item \textbf{Programming Languages}\\
    \textit{HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PhP, SqL}
\end{itemize}

\section{Glossary}

\underline{Candia Cameo}: The name of the company that will sell Moissanite Jewelry through the website.\\
\underline{Moissanite}: Moissanite is naturally occurring silicon carbide and its various crystalline polymorphs. It has the chemical formula SiC and is a rare mineral, discovered by the French chemist Henri Moissan in 1893. The type of jewelry the website will sell.\\
\underline{Customer}: a person who want to buy goods from the website.\\
\underline{Coupon}: a voucher with a code, entitling the holder to a discount off any particular jewelry from the website.\\
\underline{EditorX}: Editor X is a revolutionary web creation platform made exclusively for designers and agencies.\\
\underline{User}: Anyone who accesses the website through the any browser.\\

\section{Project Management}
\subsection{Feasibility Study}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{\textbf{Is the System worthwhile?}}\\
    \\
    The company claims that their current website is barely attracting attention, and that most of their sales are coming from Instagram users.\\
    As a Software Engineering team, we believe that the reason for the weak traffic on their website is the lack of an attractive and professional web design, as well as the lack of functionalities that provide the customers with the best online jewelry shopping experience possible.\\
    Also, for their jewelry company to be taken seriously, they must have a professional web application system that can gain the trust of frequent jewelry buyers, and can compete with many other jewelry businesses available online.
    Therefore, the implementation of an E-commerce web application system that meets a professional and attractive design, and their full business requirements, is worthwhile and a must.
    \item \underline{\textbf{Does the system contribute to the objectives of the company?}}\\
    \\
    The company's objectives are to increase their reach and their sales, to facilitate online purchases, and to provide the customer with a safe and professional jewelry shopping experience that meets the level of other well known jewelry businesses.\\
    Therefore, developing a system with an elegant design and functionalities that meet the standards of a professional online jewelry store, will most definitely contribute to the objectives of the company.
    \item \underline{\textbf{Can the system be engineered using current technology and within budget?}}\\
    \\
    Since the system is an e-commerce web application, it can most definitely be engineered using 'EditorX', which is a revolutionary web creation platform with approachable CSS and sophisticated web infrastructure made exclusively for designers to produce exceptional digital experiences for any screen imaginable, and to create and store heavy or dynamic content behind the scenes of a site using database collections. We can connect the database to individual site elements like images, and responsive display tools like Repeaters.\\
    As for the budget, the company has already paid the subscription to start working on it.
    \item \underline{\textbf{Can the system be integrated with other systems that are used?}}\\
    \\
    Engineering a website on 'EditorX' will make it automatically compatible across different browsers.\\
    Therefore, the system can be integrated with other systems that are used to browse online websites.
